# Hash Map Class
I felt like writing the HashMap class from scratch to my own specifications (original exercise from Codecademy).
This way it is easy to rewrite for example the collision avoidance algorithm and then compare the speed for assignment and retrieval with Python's built in dictionaries.
Have fun rewriting and testing :)
